Work in progress! Uploaded so i can use it in a project. The sidecar only works with my specific table. 

Forked from https://github.com/fluencelabs/curl-effector 

* works in concert with a [tableland-sidecar](https://github.com/composibleIO/cio-tableland-sidecar) which you can deploy to vercel or host yourself. 
* the sidecar runs on arbitrum testnet and should contain a private key of an account with test tokens. 
* It takes ~ 7 seconds for new data to be included on chain and synced along the distributed database
* you can insert rows into a table
* you can query the table 

to do: 
* I am experimentig with an optimistic mode
* make table information generic 
* table creation 
* batch insert
